    <h1>Masion Margiela</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <p><strong>Maison Margiela</strong>, formerly <em>Maison Martin Margiela,</em> is a French luxury fashion house founded by Belgian designer Martin Margiela and Jenny Meirens[1] in 1988 and headquartered in Paris.[2] The house produces both haute couture-inspired artisanal collections and ready-to-wear collections, with the former influencing the designs of the latter.[3] Product lines include womenswear, menswear, fine jewelry, footwear, accessories, leather goods, objects, fragrance,[2] and home goods, among others.[4] Known for deconstructive and avant-garde designs with unconventional materials,[2] Maison Margiela has traditionally held live shows in unusual settings, for example empty metro stations[5] and street corners.[6] Models' faces are often obscured[7] by fabric or long hair to direct attention to the clothes and design.[8] Margiela resigned as creative designer in 2009[9] and John Galliano was appointed to the role in 2014.[10] </p><br><br>
